            The avocado is a fruit that is native 
            to south-central Mexico, classified as a member of the flowering 
            plant family Lauraceae.

            It is known for its creamy 
            texture and mild flavor. Avocados are often used in 
            culinary applications, particularly in salads, spreads 
            <b>(such as guacamole)</b>, and sandwiches. 
            They are also a good source of healthy monounsaturated fats, 
            vitamins, and minerals.
